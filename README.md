## 👋 Hi there, I’m Aaryan Ahuja

- 👨‍🎓 I am a Sophomore at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.
- 👨‍💼 I am currently working on a research project in Deep Learning and I code mostly in Python.
- 👀 I’m interested in discovering some Machine Learning/Deep Learning/AI projects and internships.
- 🌱  I am also trying my hand at Reinforcement Learning and can also create websites using Flask, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
- 🌐 Reach out to me at LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaryan-ahuja-ab1515218/ {:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
- 🌟 Fun fact: My departmental major is nowhere associated with ML or even programming.
